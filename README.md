#### This repository contains files for the Applied Data Science Capstone of the IBM Professional Data Science Certification. 

In this Capstone, I followed Data Science methodologies involving data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and result reporting.   

My task is to predict if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully.  SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars while other provides cost is over  165 million dollars each. The reason for the  saving is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. 

By accurately predicting the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully, we can determine the cost of a launch. With the help of Data Science findings and models, the competing startup can make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch. 

I completed this capstone after completing the following courses in this certification:

- What is Data Science?
- Tools for Data Science
- Data Science Methodology
- Python for Data Science, AI & Development
- Python Project for Data Science
- Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python
