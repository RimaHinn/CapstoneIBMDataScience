#### This repository is for Capstone Project for the IBM Professional Data Science Certification 
This repository contains files for the capstone project for the IBM Professional Data Science Certification. I completed this capstone project after completing all the requirements of the 10 courses in this certification. 
I this project, I worked with real datasets and I assumed the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX. During this process,  followed Data Science methodologies involving data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and result reporting to stakeholders.   

The Task is to predict if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully.  SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars while other provides cost is over  165 million dollars each. The reason for the  saving is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. 

By accurately predicting the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully, we can determine the cost of a launch. With the help of Data Science findings and models, the competing startup can make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
